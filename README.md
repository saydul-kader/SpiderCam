# SpriderCam (A Surveillance App)
This app is a part of my project "Smart Surveillance System with Facial Recognition using IoT". Multiple Raspberry Pis are connected to the app. The Pis keep a constant eye on the camera's surroundings. When a face is detected, the Raspberry Pi takes a picture of it and sends it to the Firebase Realtime Database along with the time of detection. The data is retrieved from Firebase and displayed in the Activity log by the app. In addition, whenever an unknown face is detected, the system sends the user an alert via email.
<br>The app provides the following features:
- Real time video streaming of multiple camera
- Activity log with detected face and time of detection
## Technology Used:
- Android
- Raspberry Pi
- Pi camera
- Python
- OpenCV
- Firebase Realtime Database
- SMTP
- Motion for Linux
